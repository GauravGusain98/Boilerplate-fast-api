### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.9
2. Docker

### Installation Guideline (Docker)
1. Create a `.env` file by duplicating `.env.example`. Put the values according to your system setup.
   1. While setting up the DB, make sure to use `db` as the value for POSTGRES_HOST
2. Create a file to capture logs while development. The file path should be `logs/app.log` inside the project root directory.
3. You can run you application using a single command:
   ```sh
   docker compose up --build
   ```
   Note: The `--build` is only need when you make any dependencies changes in the project.

### Installation Guideline (Local)
1. Create a `.env` file by duplicating `.env.example`. Put the values according to your system setup.
   1. While setting up the DB, make sure to use `localhost` as the value for POSTGRES_HOST
2. Create a file to capture logs while development. The file path should be `logs/app.log` inside the project root directory.
3. Start a virtual environment
   ```sh
   pipenv shell
   ```
   Note: if you dont have pipenv then install it using `pip install pipenv`
4. Install necessary packages for development purposes locally using pipenv
   ```sh
   pipenv install --dev
   ```

### Pre-commit Hooks Installation
While doing development its good to follow best practices used in the industry. We have taken care of it by adding some tools for checking the sanity of your code when you make any commit to GitHub. To install these development tools, follow the steps mentioned below:
1. Install pre-commit and commit-linter to ensure that every time you make a commit the checks should be triggered.
   ```sh
   pip install pre-commit
   pip install commit-linter
   ```
2. Start a virtual environment (Skip if you have installed application in local environment)
   ```sh
   pipenv shell
   ```
   Note: if you dont have pipenv then install it using `pip install pipenv`

3. Install necessary packages for development purposes locally using pipenv (Skip if you have installed application in local environment)
   ```sh
   pipenv install --dev
   ```
   Note: Whenever the checks are running, make sure the you have started the virtual environment


### Testing
To test the functionality of your code and test cases. Run the test cases using the below mentioned commands after creating virtual environment using pipenv.
1. Run all the test cases
   ```sh
   pytest .
   ```
2. Run test cases of specific module
   ```sh
   pytest tests/<module_name>
   ```
3. 2. Run a specific test cases of
   ```sh
   pytest tests/<module_name>::<function_name>
   ```

### Database Migration Creation Guidelines
Whenever you want to make any changes in the DB schema please follow the below provided steps
1. Add or make changes to the models you want to update or create
2. Create a new migration file using the below command
   ```sh
   docker-compose exec app pipenv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "<details of the migration file changes>"
   ```
   Note: For local environment, just run `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "<details of the migration file changes>`
3. Run the migration to reflect the changes in the DB using the below command
   ```sh
   docker-compose exec app pipenv run alembic upgrade head
   ```
   Note: For local environment, just run `alembic upgrade head`
